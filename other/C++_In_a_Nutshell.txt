[Declarations]

A C++ source file contains a series of zero or more declarations. A declaration can
be a function, type, object (constant or variable), namespace, template, or a
related entity.

[Ambiguity]

Some language constructs can look like a declaration or an expression. Such ambiguities
are always resolved in favor of declarations. A related rule is that a
declaration that is a type specifier followed by a name and empty parentheses is a
declaration of a function that takes no arguments, not a declaration of an object
with an empty initializer.

    T(a); // Variable named a of type T, not an invocation of the T(int) constructor

    T b( ); // Function named b of no arguments, not a variable named b of type T

    T c(T(x)); // Declaration of a function named c, with one argument of type T

.. with a redundant set of parentheses around the parameter name.

If your intention is to declare an object, not a function, the simplest way to do this
is not to use the function-call style of type cast.

You can force the compiler to interpret the declaration as an object definition by enclosing
one or more arguments in parentheses:

    T c(  T(x)  );
    T d( (T(x)) );

[Scope]

A scope can be named or unnamed.

[Initializers]

The two forms of initializers are assignment-like and function-like. (In the C++
standard, assignment-like is called copy initialization, and function-like is called
direct initialization.)

[Assignment-like initializers]

To initialize an aggregate of class type, supply an initial value for each nonstatic
data member separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.

If there are fewer values than members, the members without values are initialized
by calling each member’s default constructor or initializing the members to 0.

An initializer list can be empty, which means all members are initialized to their
defaults, which is different from omitting the initializer entirely. The latter causes
all members to be left uninitialized.

[Initializing arrays]

Initialize elements of an array with values separated by commas and enclosed in
curly braces.

An array initializer can be empty, which forces all elements to be initialized to 0. If
the initializer is empty, the array size must be specified. Omitting the initializer
entirely causes all elements of the array to be uninitialized (except non-POD
types, which are initialized with their default constructors).

[Virtual Functions]

    struct base {
        virtual void func( );
    };
    struct derived : base {
        virtual void func( ); // Overload
    };
    base* b = new derived;    // Static type of b is base*.
                              // Dynamic type is derived*.
    b->func( );               // Calls dynamic::func( )
